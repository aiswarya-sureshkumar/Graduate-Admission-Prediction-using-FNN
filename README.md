# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-FNN
Overview:
In this project, we aim to build a predictive model using Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) to forecast graduate admissions. The model will analyze various factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rankings, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, and undergraduate GPA to predict the likelihood of admission into a graduate program. This project will utilize a dataset containing historical admissions data to train and evaluate the model's performance.

Technologies Used:
Python for programming,
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation,
TensorFlow.Keras for building the FNN model,
Scikit-learn for model evaluation and preprocessing

Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, we expect to have developed an accurate and reliable predictive model for graduate admissions using Feedforward Neural Networks. This model can assist prospective graduate students in assessing their likelihood of admission and help universities in streamlining their admission processes.
