# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-FNN
In this project, we aim to build a predictive model using Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) to forecast graduate admissions. The model will analyze various factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rankings, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, and undergraduate GPA to predict the likelihood of admission into a graduate program. This project will utilize a dataset containing historical admissions data to train and evaluate the model's performance.
